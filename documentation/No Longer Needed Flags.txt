    M    Make implicit range generation and while loop counter start at 0 instead of 1
    m    Make implicit range generation end at n-1 instead of n
    á¹€    Equivalent to having both m and M flags
    
 No one uses those anyway
 
     L    Print top of stack joined by newlines (Vertically) on end of execution

That's just a cursed mess.


    G    Print the maximum item of the top of stack on end of execution
    g    Print the minimum item of the top of the stack on end of execution
    
I don't think these are used very often either.

    t    Vectorise boolify on Lists

The behaviour of boolify will probably change

    D    Treat all strings as raw strings (don't decompress strings)

Different string types go brrrr

    H    Preset stack to 100

That's only ever been useful once

    c    Output compiled code

How can is compile code when there is interpret?
