# Version 3.2.0

_Alternaitvely, the regular <s>show</s> expression update_

## Breaking Changes

### Implemented

* `ṅ`'s `set difference` behaviour has been made an overload of `ṡ`.
* `ṅ` is now `palindromise`, rather than `Ḥ`.
* `Ẇ` performs the `lst, lst` overload of `ṡ` (partition into lengths)
* `Ḥ` is once again a shortcut for `ḣ$`.
* `₉` now pushes an empty string instead of an empty list


## New Elements

* `Þ0` is zero pad

## New Overloads

* `ḣ` now works on numbers
* `M` performs `regex-match` on two strings.
* `ẋ` performs `regex-search` on two strings.
* `ẋ` will also now perform `cartesian product with self` when given two lists

## Changed Overloads

None yet.

## Bug Fixes

* Subtract now properly vectorises

## Other Changes

* The online interpreter no longer uses live output by default. Chromium
browsers were having issues with a load of output request events overriding
the timeout function. Use the `,` on the online interpreter to enable live
output. Use it at your own risk on Chromium browsers.
