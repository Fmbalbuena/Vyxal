# Version 3.2.0

## Breaking Changes

### Implemented

* `ṅ`'s `set difference` behaviour has been made an overload of `ṡ`.
* `ṅ` is now `palindromise`, rather than `Ḥ`.
* `Ẇ` performs the `lst, lst` overload of `ṡ` (partition into lengths)

### Todo

* `Ḥ` is once again a shortcut for `ḣ$`.
