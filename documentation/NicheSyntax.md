This is simply all the niche syntax bits for making look nice later.

## SBCS
```
#$name -> get variable
#=name -> set variable
f#>name -> name f= top of stack
#:[x|y|z] -> x, y, z = top of stack
```

## Literate

```
$name -> get
=name -> set
f:=name -> name f= top of stack
=[x|y|z] -> x, y, z = top of stack
```
