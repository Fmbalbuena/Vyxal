The role of a lexer in a programming language is to take a big program and split it into tiny little parts called "tokens". These tokens are the "parts of speech" of a programming language, just like how things like nouns, verbs and adjectives are parts of speech of spoken languages.

The Vyxal lexer takes programs as a big string of code and uses a library called `fastparse` to split it into tokens. Each token grammar rule is converted to a
combination of "parsers". These "parsers" are a sort of functional programming
version of a regular expression, in that instead of matching against a pattern,
precise logic is used to match token values.

For example, the rule for recognising a comment is:

```
"##" ~~/ CharsWhile(c => c != '\n' && c != '\r').!
```

Which reads as:

```
"##" // Match the literal string "##"
~~/ // Set the parser to not backtrack past the ##
CharsWhile(...).! // Consume characters while:
    c != '\n' // The character is not a newline
    && c != '\r' // The character is not a carriage return
.! // Return the characters that were consumed
```

The lexer will apply all rules in a recursive descent manner, meaning that it will try to match the first rule, then the second rule, then the third rule, etc. If a rule fails to match, it will backtrack and try the next rule. If a rule matches, it will not backtrack and will continue to match the next rule.

Here is a table of all the rules in the lexer:

| TokenName               | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Example                                                                                       | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
